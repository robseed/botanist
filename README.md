#requirements

* an ubuntu server
* credentials for a user that has access to the repositories desired to be indexed (bitbucket.org and/or github.com) see: [Machine User](https://developer.github.com/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#machine-users)
* apache, nginx, or any other WSGI server for the Django webapp.

#build / installation

build and upload to target server:

```
make
scp target/botanist.tar.gz dest-server:
```

untar it on the target server, cd into the directory, and run `install.sh`

```
tar zxvf botanist.tar.gz
cd botanist
./install.sh

```

Installation will setup 2 cronsâ€¦
will also kick off initial fetch-code and index jobs
you can start up the django web app if you want to just check it out quickly by doing:

```
cd webapp/
. .env/bin/activate
./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

Then you can visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to start searching!

Of course, Django's test server won't really work in production, so you'll have to setup the webapp to run using your favorite webserver that supports WSGI (Apache, Nginx, Gunicorn, etc.)

TODO: need to reorder this...
The installation script sets up 2 periodic crons that run every half hour:

* one fetches new repositories or pulls the latest commits from bitbucket and/or github
* the other (re)indexes the source code using `cindex`

During the installation process, it will ask you what user to run things
as, as well as bitbucket and/or github credentials. It stores these
in a file that is only readable by the user it is installed under.

#packages

some software packages are included to make this work. they are included
in this repository for now for compatibility purposes.

##code search
The fast searching is made possible by the excellent codesearch tool
from Google:

https://code.google.com/p/codesearch/
(cindex running on a periodic cron to re-index)

##bitbucket repository fetching
https://github.com/samkuehn/bitbucket-backup
(running on a periodic cron to update the source code to search)
NOTE: Enclosed under ./packages is a custom fork of
samkeuhn/bitbucket-backup. I've issued several PR's that he's accepted
so he is really quick and amenable to updates, I just haven't quite
finished cleaning up the additions I made recently.

##github repository fetching
wrote up something to do this in Python based on
https://github.com/celeen/gitter

##pull requests welcome! checkout the TODOs file


# docker

### bootstrap volume mount point
```
mkdir -p $HOME/botanist/repos
```

### fetch code
```
docker run --env-file env -v $HOME/botanist/repos:/botanist/repos botanist /botanist/bin/fetch-code.sh
```

### index code
```
docker run --env-file env -v $HOME/botanist/repos:/botanist/repos botanist /botanist/bin/index.sh
```

### collect static assets to be served by nginx

**note: requires active virtualenv w/ `requirements.txt` installed**

```
cd webapp && ./manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

### start the webapp and nginx
